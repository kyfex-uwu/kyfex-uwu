hi, i'm kyfex!

i'm a 19yo developer, coding just for fun :3

🌸languages
- JavaScript - it's my first language! i'm pretty proficient in it, and i have 10+ years of experience with it, both client-side and in NodeJS ^-^
- Java - my second most used language, but my favorite (don't tell js ;3) i've used Java to make website backends, Minecraft mods, and custom games utilizing graphics libraries :3
- Lua - i learned Lua through Roblox hehe, and i'm still not 100% fluent in it; Lua-specific features like metatables still elude me @w@
- Python - not my favorite, but a great utility language ^w^ i learned Python in the winter of 2023, and have used that knowledge to tutor college CS students!
- HTML/CSS - not coding languages, but i have 5 years of experience creating webpages and interfaces with them UwU

🏔️hobbies
- i love gaming; my favorite games right now are Celeste, VRChat, and Minecraft! i love puzzle games, platformers, and rhythm games, but i'll give most games a try (except fps games, not my thing)
- i create music! i love playing piano, singing, and writing EDM, nothing released yet though x3 i've been involved in music for 6+ years, it's easily my biggest passion besides coding UwU
- i code so much (of course >w<) i write Minecraft mods and maintain [my own website](https://kyfexuwu.com). additionally, I create a lot of little JavaScript tools/games, but I currently don't have a place to showcase them ;-;
